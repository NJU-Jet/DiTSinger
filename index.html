    Diffusion Transformer for Scalable and Alignment-Free Singing Voice Synthesis

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Recent progress in diffusion-based Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) demonstrates
      strong expressiveness but remains limited by data scarcity and model scalability.
      We introduce a two-stage pipeline: a compact seed set of human-sung recordings
      is constructed by pairing fixed melodies with diverse LLM-generated lyrics,
      and melody-specific models are trained to synthesize over 500 hours of
      high-quality Chinese singing data. Building on this corpus, we propose
      <b>DiTSinger</b>, a Diffusion Transformer with RoPE and qk-norm, systematically
      scaled in depth, width, and resolution for enhanced fidelity.
      Furthermore, we design an implicit alignment mechanism that obviates
      phoneme-level duration labels by constraining phoneme-to-acoustic attention
      within character-level spans, thereby improving robustness under noisy or
      uncertain alignments. Extensive experiments validate that our approach enables
      scalable, alignment-free, and high-fidelity SVS.
